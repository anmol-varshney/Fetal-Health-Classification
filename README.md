# ðŸ˜Ž Classifying Fetal Health using Machine Learning

initial commit
Analysis carries two sorts of architecture; one is the artificial neural network and the other is machine learning algorithms Random Forest Classifier and K nearest neighbors.

Fetal health depends on many things taken from cardiogram tests such as uterine contraction, fetal movement, light deceleration, etc. Analysis went in a manner that it also involves the comparison or model accuracy among artificial neural networks, Random Forest Classifier, and K nearest neighbors. Visualization, normalization, data cleaning, feature reduction, etc, is also performed to increase the accuracy. One always looks for less time to complete tasks with fewer workouts. Ultimately, analysis has successfully implemented both neural network architectures at once with the optimized model. It is also stating the importance of the algorithms for optimization.
#### About Dataset
Fetal health is, somewhat, the health of the fetus after considering some factors that affect it. In our dataset, features like fetal heart rate, baseline heart rate value, etc.

This dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into 3 classes:
- Normal
- Suspect
- Pathological
